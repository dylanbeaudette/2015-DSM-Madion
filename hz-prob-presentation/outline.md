## Main Ideas
1. distillation of genetic horizon information from a collection of pedons into a ML profile
2. micro-correlation: use of generalized horizon labels / REGEX to group similar horizons
3. slice-wise estimation: of empirical probabilities
4. PO-logistic regression: more general model
5. ML horizon depths / ML profile

## Comparisons (Brier Scores, ... ?)
1. empirical probabilities
2. PO-logistic regression, linear terms
3. PO-logistic regression, rcs()
4. selection of "representative" profile

## Ideas to Explore
1. external validation
2. simulation from a model
3. model stability
4. model limitations (e.g. minimum sample size, ... ?)
5. more realistic estimates of SE (incorporation of correlation structure via GEE)
6. other uses of model coefficients

## Examples
1. loafercreek-- large sample size, fairly simple horizonation
2. amador or similar, smaller sample size
3. complex horizonation, ... ?
4. NZ soils data ... ?


## Key points for the talk

  - I would put even more emphasis on the first slide that morphological description has a lot to do w/ the observer (*in its larger sense*): not only to draw boundaries and qualify an hz, but also in where the pit hyas been dug (horizontal variations)
  - "morphology is in the eye of the beholder" which makes a strong point for NOT picking one actual profile in particular, but rather hope the "white noise" will level itself out if we aggregate over a collection of N profiles


## other stuff to follow-up on:
- management of GHL (mico-correlation decisions)
- simulation of likely profile "sketches" from model

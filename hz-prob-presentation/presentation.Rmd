title: 'Aggregate representation of genetic soil horizons via proportional-odds logistic regression'
output: ioslides_presentation
---

## Main Ideas
1. distillation of genetic horizon information from a collection of pedons into a ML profile
2. micro-correlation: use of generalized horizon labels / REGEX to group similar horizons
3. slice-wise estimation: of empirical probabilities
4. PO-logistic regression: more general model
5. ML horizon depths / ML profile

## Comparisons (Brier Scores, ... ?)
1. empirical probabilities
2. PO-logistic regression, linear terms
3. PO-logistic regression, rcs()
4. selection of "representative" profile

## Ideas to Explore
1. external validation
2. simulation from a model
3. model stability
4. model limitations (e.g. minimum sample size, ... ?)
5. more realistic estimates of SE (incorporation of correlation structure via GEE)
6. other uses of model coefficients

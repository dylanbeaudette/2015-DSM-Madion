# 2015-DSM-Madison
material related to the presentations and book chapters we are responsible for presenting at the 2015 Digital Soil Morphometrics conference

# TODO
Presentations.

1. Aggregate Representation of Genetic Soil Horizons

2. AQP for Digital Soil Morphometrics

3. Digital summaries of legacy pedon descriptions

I am on-board 100% for the first two, and I am co-author on number
three. I don't have time to write the chapter for 3, but may have time
for 1 and 2.

Since we have a lot to do, would you like to divy-up the work and
adjust authorship accordingly? Basically, you take first author on one
and I will on the other. Or we can put in 50-50 and flip a coin on who
is the leading author.


# Status.
The first paper in the list is likely the most interesting-- or at
least I think that it is. This should receive the most amount of
effort in terms of outlining the novelty and practical applications. I
have plenty of examples as we have been using this approach for the
last couple of years (in some areas of the US) to aggregate pedon
data. I suggest that we get the presentation figured out, then write
the paper to follow. What do you think?

Next, the AQP presentation should be fairly simple as we have a lot of
material to draw from. I haven't heard back from Alfred, but I am
assuming that we have 15-20 minutes for each presentation. A
comfortable mixture of (small) code chunks + figures, with a couple
slides of major points should be appropriate for the expected
audience. The AQP chapter is another matter. I do not want to re-hash
the Comp. & Geo.Sci. paper from 2013. A decent description of the SPC
class and _general_ morphometrics-related tasks is currently missing.
However, do we have time to write this chapter? One one hand, I think
that a chapter on AQP is a MUST for any book on digital morphometrics.
On the other, time is limited and the 2013 article + R package
documentation are fairly complete.


# Plans

1. May 4 thru 8:
  * [x] outine hz-prob presentation [done]
  * [x] outline AQP presentation
  * [x] decide on what platform to use for presentations (.Rpres) / papers (markdown / pandoc)
  * [x] decide on revision control method (github)

2. May 11 thru 15:
  * [x] draft presentations done:
    * [x] hz-prob
    * [x] AQP
  * [] collect references for both papers in bibtex format
  * [x] outline both papers
  * [] figures for both papers

3. May 18 thru 22:
  * [] finish presentations:
    * [x] hz-prob
    * [] AQP (yikes, not done!)
  * [] 50% goal for both papers (yikes, not done!)

4. May 25 thru 29: this is a short week for me
  * [] finish both papers
  * [] proof presentations / final adjustments:
    * [x] hz-prob
    * [] AQP
  * [] testing


# Suggestions / Notes:

 1. While not ideal, I have been fairly happy with the RSudio
presentation format (.Rpres)-- after significant adjustments to the default
style. However, this only makes sense if we are going to include R
code in our presentations. If not-- well, beamer would be fine.

 2. I can no longer access the  https://code.scenzgrid.org/svn/hz-prob
SVN repo, it could be that I need to update my password. If we can get
this working I am fine with using this or a related repo for our
presentations / papers.

 3. Word is the requiured submission format, therefore we should probably try using a variant of Markdown
that can deal with references. This looks promising:

Wow. That is a lot to do.

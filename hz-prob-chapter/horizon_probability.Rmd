# Abstract

Published soil survey reports typically describe soils in terms of aggregate information: soil properties, interpretations, and limitations that are based on a collection of field-described soil profiles. 
While aggregate soil properties are readily estimated via standard statistical functions (mean, median, etc.), an aggregate representation of horizonation (e.g. genetic or functional horizon designation and depth) is typically difficult to construct. 
Variation in horizon designation among different soil scientists and different soil description systems, changes in horizon designation standards over time, variable depths at which horizons occur, and the various uncertainties associated with these are all factors that complicate the process of delivering an aggregate representation of horizonation. 
In this paper we propose alternatives to the typical "representative profile" -- e.g. the selection of a single soil profile to represent a collection. Two possible methods for aggregating a collection of soil profiles into synthetic profiles are presented, describing depth-wise probability functions for each horizon. 
Both methods rely on an expert-guided description of generalized horizon designation (e.g. a subset of horizon designation labels that convey a reasonable "morphologic story") along with associated rules (regular expression patterns) used to correlate field-described to generalized horizon designation. 
The first method is based on (1-cm interval) slice-wise evaluation of generalized horizon designation; the second is based on a proportional-odds logistic regression model fit to depth-slices. 
These methods are demonstrated using USDA-NRCS soil survey data (USA).

# Introduction

Published soil survey reports typically describe soils in terms of *aggregate* information, *ie* soil properties, interpretations, and limitations that are based on a collection of field-described soil profiles. 
While aggregate soil properties are readily estimated via standard statistical functions (mean, median, etc.), an aggregate representation of *horizonation* (e.g. genetic horizon designation and depth) is typically difficult to construct [@beaudette2013]. 
Variation in horizon designation "style" among different soil scientists, changes in horizon designation standards over time, variable depths at which genetic horizons occur, and the possible lack of a specific genetic horizon are all factors that complicate the process of delivering an aggregate representation of horizonation.  The process of designating horizons by soil scientists can be somewhat subjective, and there is always error associated with it. This error is rarely acknowledged: boundaries between horizons, expressed as horizon depths, are generally considered as "crisp" numbers, while in actuality they represent "fuzzy" numbers due to the varying distinctness of the horizon boundaries and how abruptly characteristics change at horizon boundaries.

Soil profiles and their corresponding soil horizons represent a record of soil formation and encapsulate significant information about soil morphology.  Although new tools and technologies may make continuous-depth measurements of soils possible, horizon designations, have historically been the common pedological language used to annotate observations of changes in soil properties with depth [@Hartemink2014].  Within soil classification systems, horizon designations provide a morphological framework within which other properties can be measured.

In order to aggregate properties for soil horizons within a collection of soil profiles, horizons must be systematically correlated into groups of similar soil morphology. The aggregtation of horizons then becomes a conceptual profile that is synthesized to represent the central concept of the soil morphology conveyed by the entire suite of soil profiles. 
The use of generalized horizon labels (GHL) provides a framework for correlating individual soil horizons, however, traditional aggregates only provide a coarse summary of corresponding horizon depths derived for the aggregated conceptual profile. This paper presents a novel approach using a depth-slicing method in the aqp package to determine horizon depth probabilities.

We demonstrate two possible methods for aggregating a collection of soil profiles into "synthetic profiles"; describing depth-wise probability functions for each genetic horizon. 
Both methods rely on an expert-guided description of generalized horizon designation (e.g. horizon designations that are deemed representative) along with associated rules (regular expression patterns) used to correlate field-described to generalized horizon designation. 
The first method is based on (1-cm interval) slice-wise evaluation of generalized horizon designation; the second is based on a proportional-odds logistic regression model fit to depth-slices. Specialized classes for soil profile collections and depth-slicing algorithms are implemented in the [aqp](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/aqp/index.html) package for R [beaudette2013].

# Materials and Methods

## Soil Profile Data

A collection of (`r length(loafercreek)`) soil profiles from the Sierra Foothill Region of California were used to demonstrate two approaches for determining aggregate representation of genetic horizon boundaries. 
These data are included within the **soilDB** package for R [@beaudette2015]. 
These soils are associated with the  [Loafercreek](https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/L/LOAFERCREEK.html) soil series (fine-loamy, mixed, super-active, thermic ultic haploxeralfs); moderately deep soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic rocks (greenschist). The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. 
Mean annual air temperature is close to 16 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm. 
The native vegitation is blue oak and annual grass savannah. Main land uses include range, vineyards, recreation, and wild life habitat. 
This collection of soil profile data represents the work of 13 different soil scientists, with described properties spanning ranges in physical properties (related to bedrock composition).



## Horizon Generalization

Generalized horizon labels (GHL) represent an expert-guided selection of horizon designations that were consistently observed in the field, and meaningful in terms of soil morphology and management.  
These designations were determined to convey the "morphologic story" or conceptual framework of most-likely horizons typically observed in a suite of soil profiles associated with a specific soil series or map unit concept. 
The Official Series Description (OSD, [https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/L/LOAFERCREEK.html]) of the Loafercreek series typical pedon and range in characteristics defines this soil series concept. 

Once a set of GHL have been determined (```r c('Oi', 'A','BA','Bt1','Bt2','Bt3','Cr','R')```), a corresponding set of regular expression (REGEX) rules were developed to map the field-described designations into generalized designations. 
This process typically requires expert-guided review of: 1) regional patterns in horizonation style, 2) morphologic property differences by groups of field-described designation, and, 3) patterns of horizonation and properties with depth. 
The expert's field experience is thus preserved within the vector of REGEX rules. 

Evaluation of GHL via silhouette width metric [@Rousseeuw1987]

## Horizon Aggregation by Slicing

Slicing and slice-wise evaluation of horizon probability described in [AQP: A Toolkit for Soil Scientists](10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020).

```{r pro-slice, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# slice out color and horzizon name into 1cm intervals: no aggregation
max.depth <- 150
slice.resolution <- 1
slice.vect <- seq(from = 0, to = max.depth, by = slice.resolution)
s <- slice(loafercreek, slice.vect ~ genhz.soil_color + genhz)

# convert horizon name to factor
s$genhz <- factor(s$genhz, levels = hz.names)

# compute slice-wise probability: slice-wise P always sum to 1
a <- slab(loafercreek, ~ genhz, cpm=1)

# convert to long-format for plotting
a.long <- melt(a, id.vars='top', measure.vars=hz.names)
```


## Horizon Aggregation by Proportional-Odds Logistic Regression

A sequence of morphologic soil horizon designations can be modeled as an ordinal-scale variable: categorical by definition and ordered along a logical gradient, depth. Within the set of GHL associated with our sample data, "Bt2" horizons always occur after "Bt1" horizons and before "Bt3" horizons. The proportional odds logistic regression model (cumulative link model with logit link) [@McCullagh1980] is a convenient framework for estimating the probability of encountering a GHL, as conditioned by depth. The proportional odds logistic regression (PO-LR) model can be defined as:

$$ P[Y \geq j | X] = \frac{1}{1 + exp[-(\alpha_{j} + X \beta]} $$

where $P[Y \geq j | X]$ is the estimated probability of encountoring GHL $j$, $X$ is a set of predictor variables, and $\beta$ a vector of fitted regression coefficients [@Harrell2001]. In this study, the PO-LR model was fit to "sliced" horizon data; 1-cm slices of GHL and slice top depth. Restricted cubic spline basis functions with 4 knots [@Harrell2001; Hastie2009] located at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles of slice top depth were used to accommodate non-linearity.

## Model stability

PO-model stability was evaluated by repeatedly re-fitting a model to 25 randomly sampled profiles (out of 53 total), 250 times. 
ML horizon boundaries were derived from these data by evaluating the 5th-50th-95th percentiles of ML horizon boundaries computed within each simulation. 

```{r pro-model-robustness, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# encapsulate model fitting / prediction within a single function
f.test <- function(s.i, slice.vect, hz.names) {
	# fit model to a subset of the original data
	l.genhz <- try(orm(genhz ~ rcs(hzdept), data=horizons(s.i)))
	
	# sometimes the subset doesn't permit model fitting, in that case return NULL
	if(inherits(l.genhz, 'try-error'))
		return(list(predictions=NULL, model.disc.index=NULL))
	
	# otherwise generate predictions
	p <- data.frame(predict(l.genhz, data.frame(hzdept=slice.vect), type='fitted.ind'))
	names(p) <- hz.names
	p$top <- slice.vect
	
	p.long <- melt(p, id.vars='top', measure.vars=hz.names)
	mdi <- l.genhz$stats['R2']
	
	return(list(predictions=p.long, model.disc.index=mdi))
}

# init an empty list
n.reps <- 250
l.res <- list()

## TODO: it would be nice to evaluate the model at each iteration using
##       those observations that were left out
# loop a bunch of times, re-fitting the model to a subset of only 25 profiles
for(i in 1:n.reps) {
	len.vect <- 1:length(loafercreek)
	s.idx <- sample(len.vect, size=25, replace=FALSE)
	# s.left.out.idx <- setdiff(len.vect, s.idx)
	l.res[[paste('rep.', i, sep='')]] <- f.test(s[s.idx, ], slice.vect, hz.names)
}

# convert the result from a list into a data.frame, and remove very small probs.
d.res <- ldply(l.res, function(i) i$prediction)
d.res$value[which(d.res$value < 0.01)] <- NA

# extract model discrimination index
res.mdi <- unlist(sapply(l.res, function(i) i$model.disc.index))
```

## Quantification of Uncertainty

Shannon Entropy (H index) [@Kempen2009]
$$ H = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_{i} * log_{n}(p_{i})}  $$
$H$ is an index of uncertainty associated with predicted probabilities, $\mathbf{p}$, of encountering horizons $i$ through $n$ at some depth. Larger values suggest **more** confusion.

Brier scores [@Harrell2001]
$$ B = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{ ( p_{i} - y_{i} )^{2}  }  $$
$B$ is an index of agreement between predicted probabilities, $\mathbf{p}$, and horizons, $\mathbf{y}$, over depth-slices $i$ through $n$ associated with a specific horizon. Larger values suggest **less** agreement between probabilities and observed horizon labels.

# Conclusions

Ideas for the conclusion.....the ideas presented in this paper regarding modeling horizon depth probabilities are helping to bridge the soil profile/horizonation concept that is are our existing 'pedological language' with the development of continuous-depth soil morphometric measurements.  Hartemink talks about continuous functions of morphometrics decoupling the horizon as a support unit for the soil profile. Each method of describing a soil profile has its purpose.  Perhaps we should not be looking to decouple it so much as meld and anchor new continuous measurements within the horizon designation framework, thereby building new knowledge within the framework of our existing knowledge.  This is an area in which morphometrics has great potential to add value to soil survey products.  

- fact: sampling by **genetic horizon** is efficient and will continue to be important
- we can do better than picking a single, **representative profile**
- soil series **defined** by GHL rules, PO-LR model, and properties aggregated by GHL
- variability between descriptions **smoothed** as sample size increases-- *given thoughtful correlation*
- continuous **depth-functions** of genetic, or diagnostic horizons
- **most-likely** horizonation, based on depth-function crossings
- quantitative estimates of **uncertainty**: Brier scores, Shannon Entropy, etc.

## Future Work

- minimum sample sizes, model diagnostics, best-practice guidelines, etc.
- more realistic estimates of SE, e.g. correlation structure via GEE
- pedogenic interpretation of model coefficients

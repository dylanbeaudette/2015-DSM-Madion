  abstract = {The movement towards precision agriculture has led to calls for soil
	maps that are more detailed and accurate than those offered in standard
	NCSS soil surveys. Studies have shown that soil variability can be
	greater than depicted in soil surveys; in fact, delineations that
	contain at least 50% of the soil mapped are considered satisfactory
	for soil survey purposes. Lacustrine plains are relatively flat and
	often have parent materials with uniform properties. Because soils
	are usually mapped using soil-landform relationships one might expect
	soil maps in these areas to be less accurate than average; it is
	difficult to delineate between map units using soil-landform relationships
	in such subtle landscapes. We grid-mapped a field containing lacustrine-derived
	soils in central Iowa and used the grid to evaluate the soil survey
	for accuracy. Two major and two minor soils, as determined by the
	area they occupy in the field, were present. For the field as a whole,
	the two major soils were correctly identified by the soil survey
	at least 63% of the time. The two minor soils were correctly identified
	33% of the time or less by the soil survey. Large-scale soil mapping
	is expensive because of the time involved to create them in the field
	and in the office. Therefore, it is only economically beneficial
	to produce a detailed map if the map leads to significant alterations
	in the way a field is managed. In fields that may have uniform soil
	properties, it may be more cost-effective to conduct a reconnaissance
	survey first and then decide if more detailed mapping is required.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Digital soil morphometrics is defined as the application of tools and techniques for measuring and quantifying soil profile attributes and deriving continuous depth functions. This paper reviews how proximal soil sensing and other tools can be used in soil profile descriptions where techniques and toolkits have not changed in the past decades. The application of such tools is compared to standard soil profile descriptions for 11 common attributes: horizons, texture, color, structure, moisture, mottles, consistence, carbonates, rock fragments, pores and roots. These attributes are extensively used in soil classification and are indicative of many soil functions. There has been progress in distinguishing soil horizons, texture and soil color, mainly using visâ€“NIR, \{GPR\} and electrical resistivity. There is potential for in situ digital morphometrics for all attributes of a soil profile. Smaller depth increments can be sampled and analyzed, and that gives continuous depth functions of soil properties. The combined use of in situ digital morphometrics and continuous depth functions of soil properties may enhance our pedological understanding. It will take time before the toolbox of the field pedologists will be digitally enriched, but we think that digital soil morphometrics has the potential to complement existing description and analytical methods. It may yield new insights in soil horizonation, how soils form and how they could be classified.},

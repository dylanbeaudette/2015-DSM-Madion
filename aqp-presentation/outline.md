Outline
========================================================

## Main Ideas

1. framework and vocabulary for soil data modeling
2. specialized data structures to accommodate **most** soil information (soilDB companion package)
3. data vizualization via. sketches
4. re-sampling via slicing / slabbing and related vizualization
5. numerical classification
6. extensible (examples in companion sharpshootR package)

## Digital Soil Morphometrics Examples

1. ML profile generation
2. profile-level aggregate / stock estimation
3. continuous-representation of data collected from genetic horizons (e.g. depth-function estimation)
4. TODO: coalate recent work and find some more!
  5. Pierre: any recent work examples?
6. scavenge from AQP website
